A canvas is a single `.canvas.tsx` file the IDE compiles so the user can open it beside the chat. Follow the workflow below in order.

## Workflow

### 1. Decide whether to use a canvas

Use a canvas when the user requests a standalone interactive artifact or an existing `.canvas.tsx` file needs work. Use ordinary Markdown for static reports, comparisons, tables, and audit recommendations. Preserve a requested tool or output format.

### 2. Write the canvas

**Location.** Canvases live at `/Users/<user>/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/canvases/<name>.canvas.tsx`. The IDE only detects canvases written directly inside that exact directory — subfolders, alternate extensions, and other locations are not picked up. For a new canvas, always use the write file tool to create the `.canvas.tsx` file at that exact path; do not stop after telling the user the path or showing code in chat. Treat that managed `canvases/` directory as pre-provisioned by Codex itself: write the canvas file directly there and do **not** spend turns creating the directory with `mkdir` or checking whether it exists before writing. Listing its contents for other purposes (e.g. checking for existing canvases) is fine. If you can't determine the workspace directory from absolute paths already in your environment (terminals, transcripts, recently-viewed files), list `~/.cursor/projects/` rather than guessing. Use a descriptive kebab-case filename ending in `.canvas.tsx`; preserve acronym capitalization and lowercase the rest.

**File rules:**
- Exactly one `.canvas.tsx` file per canvas. Never create helper files, style files, or supporting modules.
- Import **only** from `cursor/canvas`. No relative imports, no npm packages, no Node built-ins.
- Default-export the top-level component.
- Embed all data inline. **No `fetch()`, no network calls.**

**Never render empty states.** A canvas exists to show real content. If a section, chart, table, or component has no data to display, **omit it** — do not render it with placeholder text ("Add header here", "TODO", "Example"), a "No data" message, an empty array, zeroed rows, or an empty chart frame. If the entire canvas would be empty because you don't have the underlying data, do not produce a canvas — tell the user what's missing and ask for it instead.

**Label every plot.** Charts and tables must be self-describing — a reader looking at the canvas alone should know exactly what they're seeing. For every plot include:
- A title naming the **specific metric** (not "Metrics" — "API error rate by service").
- **Axis labels with units** on both axes (e.g. "Date", "Latency (ms)").
- A **legend** when more than one series is shown, with the exact series names from the source data.
- The **source and time range** in a small caption (e.g. "Source: Datadog · last 7 days"). If a value is a transformation (mean, p95, normalized, smoothed), say so in the label.

**Component discovery:** prefer built-in `cursor/canvas` components over hand-rolled markup. The full public surface (components, hooks, prop types, tokens) is declared in `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/canvas/sdk/index.d.ts` and its sibling `.d.ts` files — read them when you need exact exports, prop shapes, or hook signatures rather than guessing. Referencing an export that does not exist is the most common runtime error.

Apply the Canvas generation policy below as you write, and complete its pre-delivery self-check (section 6) before returning the canvas.

## Design guidance

Be creative. The SDK gives you expressive building blocks — use them in whatever combination best serves the content. But avoid slop: no gradients, no emojis, no box-shadows, no rainbow coloring. Codex canvases are flat, minimal, and purposeful.

### Visual hierarchy

Not everything deserves equal treatment. Primary content gets more space, larger headings, and accent color. Supporting content stays compact. Squint test: blur your eyes — can you tell what matters?

**Color.** All colors from `useHostTheme()` tokens — read its JSDoc in the SDK declarations for the return shape and usage pattern. No hardcoded hex. Use accent color deliberately, not on everything.

### Slop patterns — forbidden

These specific patterns produce low-quality output. If 2+ are present, redesign.

- **Gradients** — no `linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, `background-clip: text`.
- **Emojis** — no emoji as icons, status indicators, bullets, or section markers.
- **Box shadows** — no `box-shadow`. Flat surfaces only.
- **Wall of identical cards** — every section wrapped in the same card style with no variation. Mix open sections with cards.
- **Rainbow coloring** — a different color on every element. Most elements are neutral; color is used sparingly with purpose.
- **Giant text** — font sizes above H1 (24px), or bold text stuffed in CardHeader.
- **Decorative borders** — colored borders on every element. Borders are structural (subtle stroke tokens), not decorative.

### Pre-delivery self-check

Before returning canvas code, verify:
1. Does the layout have visual hierarchy? One thing should stand out.
2. Is there variety in the composition? Not just a single column of uniform blocks.
3. Slop check: scan for the forbidden patterns above.

## Introducing the canvas

When you create a canvas, add a short note in your chat response telling the user you created a canvas they can open beside the chat:

- **First canvas** — if no other `.canvas.tsx` files exist in the workspace's `canvases/` directory, include one sentence explaining what a canvas is.
- **Unsolicited canvas** — if the user didn't ask for a canvas, include one sentence explaining why you chose it over plain text.

Both can apply at once; one or two sentences total is enough. Skip the intro for subsequent canvases.

## Troubleshooting

If a canvas appears blank or missing, the most common cause is that it was not written under `/Users/<user>/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/canvases/` exactly — re-save it to that path. Do not debug this by trying to create the managed directory manually; focus on correcting the file path instead. Users can click the canvas file path in the response to open it, just like any other file path in Codex. When present, the canvas server writes a `<name>.canvas.status.json` sidecar after each build with `status`, `diagnostics`, or `error` fields you can read; the file is best-effort and may not exist, so don't block on it.

## Good example

```tsx
import { Divider, Grid, H1, H2, Stack, Stat, Table, Text } from 'cursor/canvas';

export default function ServiceOverview() {
  return (
    <Stack gap={20}>
      <H1>Service Overview</H1>
      <Grid columns={3} gap={16}>
        <Stat value="6" label="Total Services" />
        <Stat value="5" label="Healthy" tone="success" />
        <Stat value="1" label="Degraded" tone="warning" />
      </Grid>
      <Divider />
      <H2>Service Status</H2>
      <Table
        headers={["Service", "Status", "Uptime", "Latency"]}
        rows={[
          ["api-gateway", "Operational", "99.99%", "12ms"],
          ["auth-service", "Degraded", "99.2%", "340ms"],
          ["billing", "Operational", "99.8%", "45ms"],
        ]}
        rowTone={[undefined, "warning", undefined]}
      />
      <Divider />
      <H2>Recent Changes</H2>
      <Text>Auth service latency increased after the 14:30 deploy.</Text>
      <Text tone="secondary" size="small">Last checked: Apr 7, 2026 14:52 UTC</Text>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

Stats in a Grid, Table directly under H2, text sections without cards.

## Bad example — do not imitate

```tsx
// BAD — every section wrapped in Card, no hierarchy, Table unnecessarily boxed
<Stack gap={12}>
  <Card><CardHeader>Summary</CardHeader><CardBody><Text>6 services.</Text></CardBody></Card>
  <Card><CardHeader>Status</CardHeader><CardBody><Table headers={[...]} rows={[...]} /></CardBody></Card>
  <Card><CardHeader>Changes</CardHeader><CardBody><Text>Latency increased.</Text></CardBody></Card>
</Stack>
```
